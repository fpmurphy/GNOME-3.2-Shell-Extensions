Notice To Packagers
-------------------

Please contact me before packaging this extension.


Purpose:
--------

Enable or disable custom theme for the panel Activities Button 


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called activitiesbutton@fpmurphy.com
should be created. 

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using: 

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -e activitiesbutton@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -d activitiesbutton@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension. 

You can also install it in the global directory
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions.
 
If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Version:
--------

V2.0  11/08/2011    Initial version for GNOME 3.2


Notes:
------

This has only been tested on Fedora 16 Beta and GNOME Shell 3.2.1

If you have other extensions that monkey patch the theme 
stylesheet or modify extension stylesheets, the interaction 
between this extension and any other such extensions may lead 
to unexpected results.

The icon included with this extension is the default Fedora logo.
You can use your own icon provided it is a 24x24 PNG icon. Just
copy the icon to the extension subdirectory and rename it 
activitiesbutton.png.

You can modify the theming by editing activitiesbutton.css.
